# The Travelling *Swiftie* Problem
This is a repository containing the code that I wrote for my article on the 
Travelling Swiftie Problem. It solves the open travelling salesman problem for 
the set of locations visited by the Tennessean girl in the song *London Boy*, 
from the album, *Lover*, by Taylor Swift.

Further, this README file contains the links to all resources and weblinks that
I mention in both the article, and in the talk.

The full article can be found 
[here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/2058802X.2024.2388417).
